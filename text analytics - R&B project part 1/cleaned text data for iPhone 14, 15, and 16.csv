Great quality, great price, fast shipping options","Really fast shipping option was great because I broke my phone. The phone is in excellent condition as described. The screen has one needle pin scratch (literally a teeny tiny dot that is less than a speck of dust) and one scratch that’s less than a mm, which is incredible. I expect some wear and tear, but it is way better than my expectations and experience buying refurbished phones. I’m very pleased. It’s as described if not better. I will be purchasing from this seller again. Great prices and reviews on their page by the way. Works like brand new and it has 86% battery life. Came with a charger box and a chord, very nice of them to include both with the amazing deal it was already at. I would recommend anyone to buy a phone from here and am eyeing another now for family. Thank you so much seller!","really fast shipping option was great because i broke my phone. the phone is in excellent condition as described. the screen has one needle pin scratch (literally a teeny

Phone works like new.","I can hardly believe this phone is refurbished - it seems brand new. I haven't bought refurbished electronics before.I usually hang on to my phones until they quit working and then buy a new one from the wireless provider, but this time I wanted an unlocked phone. It looks new and functions perfectly, and was very reasonably priced for an unlocked phone that will allow me to change wireless providers. Setting up the esim card was a bit complicated for me; I think it's easy to think something isn't working at first. Maybe it depends on your wireless provider, though. I had my tech-savvy daughter help me with the set-up, and it works great.","i can hardly believe this phone is refurbished - it seems brand new. i haven't bought refurbished electronics before.i usually hang on to my phones until they quit working and then buy a new one from the wireless provider, but this time i wanted an unlocked phone. it looks new and functions perfectly, and was very reasonably priced for an unlocked phone that will allow me to change wireless providers. setting up the esim card was a bit complicated for me;

1st purchase was great! This one was not!","I have had this iPhone for 38 days.It has the worst battery life of any iPhone I've ever owned, and I have owned ONLY iPhones since the first version was released 17 years ago.This is the second iPhone 14 that I've bought from the renewed store .The first one I bought on December 4th, 2023, and I could not have been happier with the phone.It arrived in brand new condition, and performed flawlessly.On the recommendation of a friend, I checked the battery health and charging after having it for MONTHS and it was at 100%! I was thrilled!I absolutely loved the phone!I never had a single problem with it.Unfortunately, on July 30 of this year I dropped it, and it was beyond repair.I immediately went back to the Amazon renewed store and purchased another iPhone 14 because my experience with the first one was so fantastic.It arrived in new looking condition, exactly like the one I bought in December 2023.It was not scratched or anything really noticeable, it just seemed to be ""worn"" a little bit, but I fully understood that it was a renewed phone, and any cosmetic issues were not that important to me, including the color, which, when my iPhone is in its case, you cannot tell what color it is anyway.Unfortunately, I DID NOT look at the battery health and charging when I first got the phone 38 days ago, but I did look at it about two weeks ago, and it said 93%.I thought, ok, it's a renewed phone, it's not going to have 100% battery life.I can live with that.Well, I just looked at it today and it's now at 90% battery health and charging.So this phone is dying quickly.After being fully charged it dies within hours.I have it completely set up for optimized battery life.I have lost emails and messages that I was in the middle of composing, and the phone just dies.I've been in the middle of important phone calls when the phone dies, simply because I had just fully charged it a few hours before that, and thought I would be fine for hours to come.I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery a week ago, and I was on the phone with my doctors office yesterday about my first post-op appointment, and my phone died in the middle of it.I thought I had HOURS left before the phone would die.Then I had to plug it in, and wait for it to come back alive, so I could call my doctor back and hopefully not wait a half hour after losing my place in line.On top of that is also has issues with the touchscreen being glitchy, and sometimes I have to tap on things several times to get them to work.As I said, I have been an iPhone owner/user since the very first version came out 17 years ago.I've always loved all my iPhones, and I will continue to be an iPhone user for the rest of my life.This is in no way reflection on Apple iPhones whatsoever.They are an amazing and fantastic piece of technology.I think I just got a bad one for the first time in my life.Luckily, I have just checked and I have until November 6th to return this phone, and I WILL be returning it.The problem is, what do I do in the meantime?Am I expected to buy a new one and get that shipped to me, transfer all my information from this phone to the new one, and then return this one?That is extremely hard to do financially!I am actually still paying for this phone on my Amazon Prime American Express card!Or, do I return this phone and wait until the refund has been issued and then buy another phone? Then wait until that is sent to me.I would not have a phone for at least a week in the interim, and we all know these days that's a practical impossibility.I am also having several medical issues.Like I said, I just had a total shoulder replacement surgery last Monday, September 9th, and have several upcoming follow up appointments, and physical therapy appointments.I also have several other non-related medical issues that definitely require that I have a phone.I just don't know what to do.","i have had this iphone for 38 days.it has the worst battery life of any iphone i've ever owned,

Love it 💛💛💛","Great phone in great condition. Battery health was a bit low at 90% but was in great condition and works well. I had a it of trouble setting up the Apple ID, I upgraded from an IPhone 12. I had previously disconnected my previous line so no longer have the number. Unfortunately the old number was still connected, so every time I would try to use the Apple ID connected to the iPhone 12 it would send a confirmation code to the phone number so I had no way of using the phone number. So I had to create a new Apple ID and email. Other than that everything works fine and I purchased the yellow option and love the phone and the color is cute!💛💛💛","great phone in great condition. battery health was a bit low at 90% but was in

Good phone! Good price!","I got one classified as “good.” I can’t see any damage on the phone. It looks like new. Setting it up went perfectly, absolutely no issues, and e sim was installed without problems. The battery is at 87% which is what I expected. My old phone was a year and a half old and it’s 87% too. The phone though lasts longer than the old iPhone 12.","i got one classified as “good.” i can’t see any damage on the phone. it looks like new. setting it up went perfectly, absolutely no issues, and e sim was installed without problems. the battery is at 87% which is what i expected. my old phone was a year and a half old and it’s 87% too. the phone though lasts longer than the old iphone 12.","i got one classified as “good.” i can’t see any damage on the phone. it looks like new. setting it up went perfectly, absolutely no issues, and e sim was installed without problems. the battery is at 87% which is what i expected. my old phone was a year and a half old and it’s 87% too. the phone though lasts longer than the old iphone 12.","i got one classified as “good.” i can’t see any damage on the phone. it looks like new. setting it up went perfectly, absolutely no issues, and e sim was installed without problems. the battery is at 87% which is what i expected. my old phone was a year and a half old and it’s 87% too. the phone though lasts longer than the old iphone 12.",i got one classified as “good” i can’t see any damage on the phone it looks like new setting it up went perfectly absolutely no issues and e sim was installed without problems the battery is at 87 which is what i expected my old phone was a year and a half old and it’s 87 too the phone though lasts longer than the old iphone 12,i got one classified as “good” i can’t see any damage on the phone it looks like new setting it up went perfectly absolutely no issues and e sim was installed without problems the battery is at  which is what i expected my old phone was a year and a half old and it’s  too the phone though lasts longer than the old iphone ,i got one classified as “good” i can’t see any damage on the phone it looks like new setting it up went perfectly absolutely no issues and e sim was installed without problems the battery is at  which is what i expected my old phone was a year and a half old and it’s  too the phone though lasts longer than the old iphone ,i got one classified as “good” i can’t see any damage on the phone it looks like new setting it up went perfectly absolutely no issues and e sim was installed without problems the battery is at  which is what i expected my old phone was a year and a half old and it’s  too the phone though lasts longer than the old iphone ,got one classified “good” can’t see damage phone looks like new setting went perfectly absolutely issues e sim installed without problems battery expected old phone year half old it’s phone though lasts longer old iphone,got one classifi “good” can’t see damag phone look like new set went perfectli absolut issu e sim instal without problem batteri expect old phone year half old it’ phone though last longer old iphon,get one classify “ good ” can ’ t see damage phone look like new set go perfectly absolutely issue e sim instal without problem battery expect old phone year half old it ’ s phone though last longer old iphone,"['get', 'one', 'classify', '“', 'good', '”', 'can', '’', 't', 'see', 'damage', 'phone', 'look', 'like', 'new', 'set', 'go', 'perfectly', 'absolutely', 'issue', 'e', 'sim', 'instal', 'without', 'problem', 'battery', 'expect', 'old', 'phone', 'year', 'half', 'old', 'it', '’', 's', 'phone', 'though', 'last', 'longer', 'old', 'iphone']"

Great seller, issues with 18.0.1 update and porting old to new phone but found a workaround","The seller is great, we had to send back the first phone because we thought it was defective, it turned out that there is a significant conflict with the portability of the old phone information and 18.0.1 upgrade.  When we cut on the phone we set it up to transfer the old phone material first, then it wanted to upgrade the software prior to the transfer.  The upgrade spooled around for 18 hrs, then the portability function (over WiFi and Cloud) simply would not work.  AT&T couldnt figure it out....we sent the phone back thinking it was defective (turns out it was fine), got a new phone same model, etc.New phone had the same issues, and I was thinking at this point it cannot be coincidence so it must me a software conflict.  And....it was.  After MUCH tinkering with it here is the workaround for those of you who are in the same situation (as an aside, we were upgrading my wife's ancient XE to a 14 but I think this happens with a lot of phones no matter the model)1.  Cut on the new phone2.  Opt to NOT set up the new phone with the old phone (ie, do NOT transfer the old phone data yet).3.  Go to settings, opt to update the software to 18.0.14.  After this, ERASE the phone.  It will keep 18.0.1 on there, it will remove any impediments to port over the information.5.  KEEP the e-sim information on there(it gives you that option when you erase, it is ok not to do it but you will have to put it back on so just keep it on).6.  Boot the phone back up7.  OPT to set it up with the old phone (likely the older phone will prompt you for this first).8.  You can set it up over Wifi or Cloud, make sure you have backed up the old phone on the cloud just before set up if you opt for that.9.  There is an option to use direct cabling to transfer, but it is a pain because Apple insists on using the proprietary cabling they have, so it means you have to first port everything onto a laptop then transfer it.  Safer but not any quicker.  I would not do that unless you have cloud issues and/or bad WiFi.Phone has worked great since we did the workaround, and I want to compliment the seller as they were quick to send a replacement phone to us and very communicative on the issues.  I hope the workaround here helps others, it was utterly baffling to us.  Apple needs to get it together on the portability issues since they just released the new model and apparently this is an issue with a number of older to newer transfers, very disappointing for them to not catch this.","the seller is great, we had to send back the first phone because we thought it was defective, it turned out that there is a significant conflict with the portability of the old

Refurbished, but not “like new”","I purchased this as I wanted a newer phone and this seemed a less expensive way to go. I was a refurbished iPhone 14. It came in a nice box and a charger cable, but not a charger. Not usually a problem as most people over time accumulate several them over time. It looked brand new and works fine. Unfortunately, I had assumed that refurbished meant “like new”, but apparently it also means “it was checked out, cleaned up and it works”. What it does not mean is a new battery. Mine had a battery with 84% charge capacity. In fairness, the company’s fine print indicates this so that’s on me to have overlooked that. In fairness I did get a “newer” phone just not one that was “like new” which meant like a new one, not just close. So, the iPhone is a newer one and works well, just will not hold a charge as long. If that doesn’t matter then this a good choice.","i purchased this as i wanted a newer phone and this seemed a less expensive way to go. i was a refurbished iphone 14. it came in a nice box and a

Not upset about it but it doesn’t follow what Amazon says. Battery was at 100% health so It makes up for the scratches. But i am a bit disappointed in that there were scratchesBesides that the phone is in good condition, was a bit of scuff marks on the side but a case hid that.

Broken camera","Overall good purchase. Fast shipping and the phone is almost great.

Better off getting a new one","All of this was experienced in the span of about 24-48 hours, and due to my work, I couldn’t keep the device because of the performance issues experienced:I needed a phone quick because my last phone died. While I appreciate the quick turn around on my order and delivery, the device had issues.For starters, the refurbished one I ordered and received took a long time to set up. You couldn’t just pair it with another device to get everything transferred. If you tried this, you would see the latest update would take days to complete and the timeline never changed.I reached out to apple and they helped me get it set up, however, there were several performance issues with the device I received.Total time it took to get the phone set up: 6.5 hours.Details: Started at 4pm as soon as the device was delivered, and after seeing the update was still not completed around 9pm, I worked with Apple support to get the device finally set up around 10pm.Performance issues:The charging port was loose, so even if the device was connected to a plug in charger, it wouldn’t always charge. This also impacted connection to CarPlay when driving. The phone would be sitting in the seat beside me, plugged in, but if it moved slightly, the connection wouldn’t work and I’d have to unplug it and plug it back in. It’s not tight enough to keep a good connection.There was an issue with screen responsiveness and phantom typing. If you needed to tap or select anything closer to the edge of the screen, it wouldn’t register. At times the screen wouldn’t respond at all, or if it was face down and I picked it up, I would see it was randomly typing characters in the Home Screen search box. I would have to manually turn the screen off (side button) for it to stop.There was also an issue with the front facing camera and sensor. The camera was really fuzzy and not able to pick up anything at times. The sensor wouldn’t always correctly adjust the screen brightness over the night I had it.The physical device itself also has scratches and dents all over it. While I don’t care about cosmetic as much as the above, the phone I received was more along the lines of poor condition overall.For this seller, I think it would be a good idea to do more intensive performance testing with the phones/devices before you send them out. You should also include correct setup instructions with the devices so your customers can set them running with ease and not have to waste half a day trying to get the phone setup to work.Overall, with the issues and hassle I experienced with the device I was sent, it was more cost effective to go buy the same model in new condition for the additional $100 at a local Best Buy.","all of this was

unplug it and plug it back in. it’s not tight enough to keep a good connection.there was an issue with screen responsiveness and phantom typing. if you needed to tap or select anything closer to the edge of the screen, it wouldn’t register. at times the screen wouldn’t respond at all, or if it was face down and i picked it up, i would see it was randomly typing characters in the home screen search box. i would have to manually turn the screen off (side button) for it to stop.there was also an issue with the front facing camera and sensor. the camera was really fuzzy and not able to pick up anything at times. the sensor wouldn’t always correctly adjust the screen brightness over the night i had it.the physical device itself also has scratches and dents all over it. while i don’t care about cosmetic as much as the above, the phone i received was more along the lines of poor condition overall.for this seller, i think it would be a good idea to do more intensive performance testing with the phones/devices before you send them out. you should also include correct setup instructions with the devices so your customers can set them running with ease and not have to waste half a day trying to get the phone setup to work.overall, with the issues and hassle i experienced with the device i was sent, it was more cost effective to go buy the same model in new condition for the additional $100 at a local best buy.","all of this was experienced in the span of about 24-48 hours, and due to my work, i couldn’t keep the device because of the performance issues experienced:i

a long time to set up. you couldn’t just pair it with another device to get everything transferred. if you tried this, you would see the latest update would take days to complete and the timeline

Quality",Just ordered this phone and overall it is decent for the price it is a very nice phone however it does have some flaws for example there is not much many settings for the phone so you are limited on options on settings pretty much it is basic settings as well as on top of screen when you scroll down with your finger basic options so overall I found it to simple yet it is nice for price of this phone. One thing I dislike is the sound quality when your taking on the phone there's no advance options to increase volume so the volume is lower than expected compared to other phones and I already have the volume as high it can be however it does sound clear so that helps to hear what the person is saying yet it would be really nice if it did have an advanced option to increase volume one thing I did notice was the last update in 2020? Not sure if it is suppose to be like that but I tried updating and says it is up to date?

Wonderful product and would recommend!","I had an older android and was having a hard time deciding what, and when to get, a new phone. I love Android and I was really intrigued with the Google and Asus phones. I have had a galaxy since the beginning of smart phones it would seem. Well, looking at all options as well, the red iPhone caught my attention solely in color. I know IPhone is a good phone, for the most part, everyone I know seems to have iPhone or Galaxy. I have never owned an iPhone and they are much more expensive than the phones I was looking at. But the red iPhone, I just kept coming back to. I started looking into the differences, and then started looking into refurbished. I have also never purchased a refurbished phone. The price difference for a “Premium” or “excellent” condition iPhone, was significantly cheaper than buying brand new. I went back and forth on Amazon, with different sellers based on reviews, and ended up landing in the option where it is sold and shipped by Amazon themselves (which I thought was more likely to be exactly what is described in their product page). I will say the first try to purchase did not go through, so there were some issues with the monthly insurance plan for the phone. But the second time it did go through, and I was having to wait probably 4 days for it to get here. I was so excited, like a kid waiting for Christmas to get here.Finally the iPhone arrived, and in absolute perfect condition. I went with the “premium refurbished” option. The delivery was incredibly secure and the driver was extra helpful before they arrived so we could time it. I opened the box and there is not one scratch or thing that would tell you that this isn’t a brand new phone. It comes with a charger, block and the phone information on a leaflet (that would otherwise be in the original iPhone packaging). I did wait to activate it, until I had time to go into a physical carrier store, but I backed up everything before I did that in my old phone. It took maybe 5 minutes for the associate at my carrier store, to set the iPhone up and transfer everything I wanted from my galaxy and the service, to the iPhone. I was worried based on other reviews that it could possibly not be unlocked to all carriers, but it was. One of the main reasons I chose to buy the refurbished option from the sold by/ships by Amazon option, because I trusted the accuracy of the description more.ALL THAT SAID beautiful phone, looks brand new, works like it’s brand new, has 100% battery life out of the box and is very easy to get used to (even if you have had an android all your adult life). I definitely recommend this product and Amazon as the seller to ensure you get what you are looking for. I am SO happy with my purchase and when it comes time to get a new phone a few years from now, I will be starting here this time! The RED color is beautiful!!!","i had an older android and was having a hard time deciding what, and when to get, a new phone. i love android and i was really intrigued with the google and asus

iPhone 14 Amazon Renewed Premium sold by Amazon","Amazon iPhone 14 ReviewRather than going into all the nifty  upgraded details and features of the IPhone 14, this will be more of a summary of some key features with emphasis on Amazon’s  renewed /refurbished program for IPhones.iPhone 14 is a terrific phone with very good battery life especially compared to the previous iPhone mini iterations which sports smaller batteries.  Also, Apple has removed the physical SIM slot for IPhone 14 for US customers.Transitioning and transferring data from a physical sim from an older iPhone to iPhone 14 wasn’t difficult.  It was fairly similar to the previous method:  having stable network/wifi, bringing the iPhones together and just follow the instructions as they come up.  It would seem that there may be cases where a bit of hiccup may occur during the data transfer when the WiFi/network is lost, as was the case for us.  Initially, both the old and new iPhone was on the home network/wifi, but midway through, iPhone 14 reverted to cellular network 5g.  As a result, the data transfer took slightly longer than expected but still managed to complete within 1.5hours.  This was approximately 175gb of data using the 5g cellular network because of the WiFi/home network faux pas (disconnection).This is the 3rd time we’ve ordered through Amazon’s Renewed Premium program (pre-owned/refurbished). The first 2 times was actually sold by a third party.  Our experiences have been decent, given the discounted price and reasonably decent quality as advertised.This time for the IPhone 14, we decided to go with Amazon Renewed Premium and actually sold by Amazon.  Given the same price or even slightly higher we believe it to be a very worthwhile move.  See attached pictures for the packaging, the care/attention and assurance of quality & condition.Amazon also have renewed conditions of Excellent, Good and Acceptable.  Depending on the needs and budget they may be suitable alternatives.  However, since we have not made purchases in these conditions we won’t be able post comments or reviews.The price for the condition and quality has definitely exceeded our expectations this time around.  It’s possible that we may have been lucky this time around or perhaps  Amazon has higher standards, thus products (especially pre-owned/refurbished) sold directly by Amazonhave higher probability of being consistently exceptional when compared to third party.Nevertheless, as we are quite impressed and satisfied with Amazon Renewed Premium condition sold by Amazon, that will be our likely first choice going forward.  The second choice will be Amazon renewed Premium condition sold by third party.It has been approximately 5 weeks since we’ve received and have been using the phone.  So far so good, battery capacity remains at 100%.","amazon iphone 14 reviewrather than going into all the nifty  upgraded details and features of the iphone 14, this will be more of a summary of some

Brick Stolen Device","If I could send negative stars I would. The phone looked great and it was a great deal;however the device was unable to be activated due to it being reported lost or stolen. This was for a teenager who had already been without a phone for 3days now having to return the device. The customer service representative had no idea what I was talking about. I’ve worked in the cell phone industry, when a phone especially an iPhone is reported lost or stolen you cannot activate the device ANYWHERE hence the name brick it’s basically as good as a brick. I was told nothing could be done about it while I just ship the phone back half to waive for my $700 to be refunded to me while my teenager is still waiting without a phone and I’m without money. I’ve also had all carriers and not one made me sit without a phone or a refund processed right away. To top it off I asked to speak to a supervisor and when I told the supervisor the phone was reported lost or stolen she called me a liar and told me that’s simply not true!! Amazon did not do its due diligence by inspecting the phone properly. There is a national database for lost/stolen phones if they did they job accurately and checked not one but both the IMEI’s since it only has an eSIM they would have caught that it was reported! But for an Amazon employee to call me a liar? Are you kidding me? Don’t buy a “renewed” device from Amazon or risk having a yourself $500-$700 brick losing out of money and being without a phone! Not even an adjustments credits nothing but being humiliated without money and no product.","if i could send negative stars i would. the phone looked great and it was a great deal;however the device

""premium""... ""PREMIUM""...?","I ordered this with the assumption that I would receive a 8-9/10 second hand phone, which, in some cases, it was.  The physical condition was good, it turned right on.  After finally getting everything moved over I was greeted with an unexpected less-than-stellar message on my screen stating that the phone had an unsupported/unrecognized component (the screen).  This message is persistent, leaving a badge on the settings on the settings icon.  Definitely not a ""premium"" experience, to say the least, but alas, here we were.  I decided, it's fine, I'll keep it regardless- I can get past the notifications about the 3rd party component, albeit an annoying reminder of the term ""premium"".  I purchased another refurbished phone, this time from a different vendor on Amazon -  an iPhone 15 plus for my mother.  The phone is perfect, no issues whatsoever, now this, this felt closer to ""premium"".  I only mention that because I did not purchase the ""premium"" version of there refurbished devices.Fast forward a few days, my phone dies, gee.  Seems like I'm constantly charging this phone... Maybe it's placebo, maybe it's ""premium"" - who knows.  After the phone dies, I plug it in, but I'm not getting the battery icon to show up. I let it sit for a while, knowing it's on an oem charger and brick.  I go to turn it on, and it's not.. doing anything.  I go to reset the phone maybe, holding the volume up + unlock button. My flash begins to turn on and off, and a siren starts to play anytime I hold it!  After googling the symptoms, I come across something talking about it's caused from major hardware failure - aka the ""premium"" experience! Turns out it was activating SOS mode, nice!  Disgruntled, I decided maybe I should return this device, maybe I'm just not cut out for this whole ""premium"" experience, I should've just stayed in my lane.  With my mastering of the arts of the procrastinator, I quickly shelved the thought and moved on it from as I need a phone pretty much always (totally not for short form content consumption and totally for important business delegations), and I get a sneaking suspicious the return process is going to have some ""premium"" surprised in store for me.  But this phone, this phone knew I wasn't the ""premium"" user it was made to furnish, and has since locked up two more times with scan lines littered throughout the screen, ahem, I mean, ""premium"" scan lines.So here we are - my ""premium"" procrastination skills have been tested and found to bear fault, so I began the return process and ordered a new phone, this time, though.. Although the phone I ordered isn't ""premium"", it's considered excellent, and here's to hoping I don't end up having to pay a ""premium"" for some excellence.tldr; It's a refurbished phone, there will be quirks and mistakes, but don't label something as premium with a jank screen, I didn't even get into the details about how the image quality was very subpar on the device, not sharp, dull, slow, unresponsive at times, etc.  The condition of the phone is good and I can only assume that is the extent that Amazon inspects these devices outside of turning on and turning off to determine functionality.  The only premium with this product unfortunately was the pricing!","i ordered this with the assumption that i would receive a 8-9/10 second hand phone, which, in some cases, it was.  the physical

Great quality, 100% battery health, verizon users should use the app for activation","appears brand new with 100% battery health. A tip for verizon users (like me) so you don’t waste hours (like me): migrate your data to your new iphone, update the ios over wifi, and then use the verizon APP for the cellular activation.

Couldn’t connect it to my cell service carrier.","Pros:-No cracks or scratches-Is an official iPhone 14-Was able to turn it on and set it upCons:-Couldn't connect the phone to get service. Trust me when I say I tried. I am a loyal Straight Talk customer, so when I got this unlocked phone, I immediately tried to switch my current service over. As the 14 is ESIM only, I tried transferring it from nearby phone. It told me that my service was invalid to transfer to eSim. Weird, but no worries. I went to the straight talk site and tried setting up new service for the 14. It told me that the IMEI and IMEI2 were invalid. I called straight talk and texted them, and they both said it was invalid and kept asking if I was sure it was a 14. After hours of trying with straight talk, I decided to try Mint Mobile. Entered my IMEI2 and they said it was compatible. So I bought a plan with them and started the process of adding an eSim with them. Only to be told that it was unable to activate the eSim. Again, I tried for hours troubleshooting any problems with mint mobile customer service and even ordered a replacement eSim. I restarted the process and was told once more that it was unable to activate the eSim. I tried searching the problem myself and came up with nothing. At this point, I wasted a lot of time trying to set it up and it all led nowhere. So, only 48 after getting the phone, I returned it and will hopefully receive my refund soon.Conclusion:If you want to take a chance, go for it, as there’s other reviews stating that the phone worked for them. I can’t say for sure whether it was a prepaid plan issue, an apple issue, or an Amazon issue, but I just know I couldn’t get what I needed from the phone. I’m keeping the review at 3 stars, because although I had to return it after it giving me a lot of trouble, everything else from the delivery to the state of the phone was perfect. I wish you better luck than I had if you order!","pros:-no cracks or scratches-is an official iphone 14-was able to turn it on and set it upcons:-couldn't connect the phone to get service. trust me

Premium Renewed 100% worth it.","Got this for my mom after buying a different renewed iPhone that had a bowed screen (tried many screen protectors a none would fit properly) and it had a bad charging port. The Amazon Premium renewed option is definitely the way to go. Screen was flawless (no scratches or anything) in fact, the iPhone was practically brand new. Couldn’t even tell it was used (which by the warranty still on the phone, it was only 4ish months old.) Got extra lucky with the one we got since the battery was at 100% capacity and the iPhone still has Apple Care for nearly a whole year. Wish I would have just gotten her this one right away, even if it was $100 more. The phone quality alone was worth it. Not everyone will be quite as lucky, but I’m sure you’ll receive a phone well worth the “Premium” Renewed name.","got this for my mom after buying a different renewed iphone that had a bowed screen

wrong carrier","ok, so the quality of the product was great. the phones were in great condition, couldn't be happier about that. but here is the problem. i paid for the ones that belong to the at&t carrier. but when i took them to at&t to get activated, they told me that they were locked to another carrier. so after running around and trying to get them unlocked, i find out that i got sent tmobile ones. i ended up having to get them unlocked thru an independent business, because At&t wouldnt help me, and the apple store really wouldn't help me. if they wouldve just sent me the right phones from the start then there would be absolutely no issues with my purchase. but i see this is somewhat of a common issue here.","ok, so the quality of the product was great. the phones were in

First one could not be activated because it was stolen","The first one we ordered was a huge headache. Three hours at the phone store trying to activate it only to find out that it was blacklisted because the previous owner had reported it as stolen.

Most frustrating phone I’ve ever dealt with","First off I just want to say if I didn’t previously have an iPhone this process would have been even more frustrating. Open the package and there’s no charger in the box. If I didn’t previously have an iPhone I wouldn’t have been able to charge the phone because when I powered on the iPhone the battery was dead, so luckily, I already had an iPhone to begin with otherwise I would’ve been screwed and I had to go out of my way to go buy a charger. now with setting up the phone was also kind of difficult since I had to switch over from a physical sim to an e-sim so I recommend making an appointment prior with your internet provider to get that switch over and make it an easier process. now with that being said ever since I got the phone the front camera worked perfectly at first and then after a few days is now blurry. I’ve done some research and I’ve done all of the things online to try and make it un blurry and it’s still blurry . The phone does not hold a charge even though the battery is at maximum capacity of 100% it takes about four hours to reach a full hundred percent charge with that. I also still didn’t get the charger along with that so that also could be a reason why it’s taking so long to charge. I’m not really sure. I can’t even update the iPhone to the newest iOS update even though the phone is at over 50Percent , the picture I have shown above was not when I first attempted to try and update the phone for anyone curious in that regard. In my personal opinion I’ll probably be returning the phone and just going straight to the Apple Store and just spending $100 more rather than having to deal with this. Hopefully some of y’all can learn from my experience and just go out of your way and spend a little bit more money to get what you’re actually looking for. The price is not worth the hassle in my opinion.","first off i just want to say if i didn’t previously have an iphone this process would have been even more frustrating. open the package and there’s

powered on the iphone the battery was dead so lucky i already had an iphone to begin with otherwise i would’ve been screwed and i had to go out of my way to go buy a charger now with setting up the phone was also kind of difficult since i had to switch over from a physical sim to an sim so i recommend making an appointment prior with your internet provider to get that switch over and make it an easier process now with that being said ever since i got the phone the front camera worked perfectly at first and then after a few days is now blurry i’ve done some research and i’ve done all of the things online to try and make it un blurry and it’s still blurry  the phone does not hold a charge even though the battery is at maximum capacity of  it takes about four hours to reach a full hundred percent charge with that i also still didn’t get the charger along with that so that also could be a reason why it’s taking so long to charge i’m not really sure i can’t even update the iphone to the newest ios update even though the phone is at over percent  the picture i have shown above was not when i first attempted to try and update the phone for anyone curious in that regard in my personal opinion i’ll probably be returning the phone and just going straight to the apple store and just spending  more rather than having to deal with this hopefully some of y’all can learn from my experience and just go out of your way and spend a little bit more money to get what you’re actually looking for the price is not worth the hassle in my opinion,first want say didn’t previously iphone

Like new with 1 year Amazon warranty","I was nervous after reading reviews about phones that had imperfect screens or weren't unlocked, but I couldn't be happier with my purchase so far. It truly appears brand new. I couldn't find a single scratch or smudge on the screen or body of the phone, and the battery health says it's 100%. It's a dual eSIM phone, as expected, and per an online IMEI lookup, both are unlocked. Also, Amazon doesn't make it easy to find the terms of its ""Renewed"" and ""Renewed Premium"" program, but the renewed has a 90-day warranty and the premium has 1 year. I think the price differential is worth it for the longer warranty. As for the phone itself: I wish it were a little thinner, like my old iPhone SE, but in exchange for the extra size I have a much better battery and significantly larger screen. I don't like the lavender color I chose - it's so pale it looks more like a dirty white. But that's my bad for choosing a color without finding a real world example to look at first.I have a prepaid Verizon plan and it was a bit of a pain to transition from my old phone, with its physical SIM, to the new eSIM phone, but I got it done at the Verizon store in about half an hour. (Efforts to get help by phone or Verizon chat were useless.)","i was nervous after reading reviews about phones that had imperfect screens or weren't unlocked, but i couldn't be happier with my purchase so far. it truly appears brand new. i couldn't find a single scratch or smudge on the screen or body of the phone, and the battery health says it's 100%. it's a dual esim phone, as expected, and per an online imei lookup, both are unlocked. also, amazon doesn't make it easy to find the terms of its ""renewed"" and ""renewed premium"" program, but the renewed has a 90-day warranty and the premium has 1 year. i think the price differential is worth it for the longer warranty. as for the phone itself: i wish it were a little thinner, like my old iphone se, but in exchange for the extra size i have a much better battery and significantly larger screen. i don't like the lavender color i chose - it's so pale it looks more like a dirty white. but that's my bad for choosing a color without finding a real world example to look at first.i have a prepaid verizon plan and it was a bit of a pain to transition from my old phone, with its physical sim, to the new esim phone, but i got it done at the verizon store in about half an hour.

iPhone 14","I was a little skeptical about spending this kind of money on a phone that I wasn’t sure was going to work. But luckily, I took the chance based off of some of the other reviews and purchased the iPhone 14. So, I also wanted to add my experience for the next person who may feel the same way.

Practically brand new","From the description of the listing I was expecting a near new phone with minimal wear. What I got was a phone that is practically new, inside and out. Everything works as expected on it, the battery shows 100% capacity, there isnt a single scratch on either the glass or metal. Not even where you plug it in to charge. The previous owner must have used it for a short period of time and kept it in a case. The package was alright, the included charger and brick is straight up e-waste and if Amazon really cared about the environment they would either include a real apple charger or nothing at all. That being said I could care less about the included charger since I already have one and was expecting it to be trash since they only specified it would be compliant to apple's standards. This review is for a Renewed Premium so keep thar in mind.","from the description of the listing i was expecting a near new phone with minimal wear. what i got was a phone that is practically new,

Great value","After searching for the best deal on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, I decided to take a chance on this Verizon-carrier refurbished model from Amazon with 256GB storage. I couldn't be happier with my decision!Condition: Virtually FlawlessFirst and foremost, if you're hesitant about buying refurbished, don't be—at least not with this listing. My phone arrived in what appears to be pristine condition. No scratches, scuffs, or signs of previous use. The screen is perfect, and the titanium frame looks brand new. If I hadn't known it was refurbished, I would have assumed it was a new device.Performance & Battery Life: Zero CompromisesThe A17 Pro chip in this phone is blazing fast. Apps open instantly, gaming performance is stellar, and I haven't experienced any slowdowns or crashes. The 256GB of storage is the sweet spot for me—plenty of room for photos, videos, and apps without paying for excessive storage I wouldn't use.Battery life has been exceptional. I easily get through a full day of heavy use with 20-30% battery remaining. Fast charging and MagSafe compatibility work perfectly as expected. Camera System: Professional-Quality ResultsThe camera system on the iPhone 15 Pro Max continues to impress me daily. The 48MP main camera captures incredible detail, and the ultrawide and telephoto lenses give me creative flexibility I never had with previous phones. The Action button makes accessing the camera lightning fast, and the results are consistently stunning even in challenging lighting conditions.Verizon Carrier ExperienceActivation with Verizon was seamless. The phone came ready to connect to the network, and I haven't experienced any carrier-specific issues. Call quality is excellent, and 5G performance is fast and reliable in my area.Value: UnbeatableThe substantial savings compared to buying new made this purchase a no-brainer. Getting essentially the same experience as a new iPhone 15 Pro Max at a reduced price feels like a smart financial decision.Bottom LineIf you're considering this refurbished iPhone 15 Pro Max from Verizon through Amazon, I highly recommend it. The combination of like-new condition, full functionality, and significant cost savings makes this one of the best tech purchases I've made. This is how refurbished products should be—indistinguishable from new but easier on your wallet.","after searching for the best deal on an iphone 15 pro max, i decided to take a chance on this

Best phone I’ve ever had!!!","I’m so glad I bought this phone! I’ve never had a newer phone and buying from Amazon was wayyy cheaper than buying from any carrier or even apple themselves. The battery life is at 100% and when I got the phone the cycle count was only 125. No scratches, nicks or cracks the phone was in perfect condition (very thankful for that.) For shipping it did arrive a day late but I’m sure it was just fedexs problem otherwise it came within 3-4 days of ordering. I also had no problem setting it up by myself.","i’m so glad i bought this phone! i’ve never had a newer phone and buying from amazon was wayyy cheaper than buying from any carrier or even apple themselves. the battery life is at 100% and when i got the phone the cycle count was only 125. no scratches, nicks or cracks the phone was in perfect condition (very thankful for that.) for shipping it did arrive a day late but i’m sure it was just fedexs problem otherwise it came within 3-4 days of ordering. i also had no problem setting it up by myself.","i’m so glad i bought this phone! i’ve never had a newer phone and buying from amazon was wayyy cheaper than buying from any carrier or even apple themselves. the battery life is at 100% and when i got the phone the cycle count was only 125. no scratches, nicks or cracks the phone was in perfect condition (very thankful for that.) for shipping it did arrive a day late but i’m sure it was just fedexs problem otherwise it came within 3-4 days of ordering. i also had no problem setting it up by myself.","i’m so glad i bought this phone! i’ve never had a newer phone and buying from amazon was wayyy cheaper than buying from any carrier or even apple themselves. the battery life is at 100% and when i got the phone the cycle count was only 125. no scratches, nicks or cracks the phone was in perfect condition (very thankful for that.) for shipping it did arrive a day late but i’m sure it was just fedexs problem otherwise it came within 3-4 days of ordering. i also had no problem setting it up by myself.",i’m so glad i bought this phone i’ve never had a newer phone and buying from amazon was wayyy cheaper than buying from any carrier or even apple themselves the battery life is at 100 and when i got the phone the cycle count was only 125 no scratches nicks or cracks the phone was in perfect condition very thankful for that for shipping it did arrive a day late but i’m sure it was just fedexs problem otherwise it came within 34 days of ordering i also had no problem setting it up by myself,i’m so glad i bought this phone i’ve never had a newer phone and buying from amazon was wayyy cheaper than buying from any carrier or even apple themselves the battery life is at  and when i got the phone the cycle count was only  no scratches nicks or cracks the phone was in perfect condition very thankful for that for shipping it did arrive a day late but i’m sure it was just fedexs problem otherwise it came within  days of ordering i also had no problem setting it up by myself,i’m so glad i bought this phone i’ve never had a newer phone and buying from amazon was way cheaper than buying from any carrier or even apple themselves the battery life is at  and when i got the phone the cycle count was only  no scratches picks or cracks the phone was in perfect condition very thankful for that for shipping it did arrive a day late but i’m sure it was just feels problem otherwise it came within  days of ordering i also had no problem setting it up by myself,i’m so glad i bought this phone i’ve never had a newer phone and buying from amazon was way cheaper than buying from any carrier or even apple themselves the battery life is at  and when i got the phone the cycle count was only  no scratches picks or cracks the phone was in perfect condition very thankful for that for shipping it did arrive a day late but i’m sure it was just feels problem otherwise it came within  days of ordering i also had no problem setting it up by myself,i’m glad bought phone i’ve never newer phone buying amazon way cheaper buying carrier even apple battery life got phone cycle count scratches picks cracks phone perfect condition thankful shipping arrive day late i’m sure feels problem otherwise came within days ordering also problem setting,i’m glad bought phone i’v never newer phone buy amazon way cheaper buy carrier even appl batteri life got phone cycl count scratch pick crack phone perfect condit thank ship arriv day late i’m sure feel problem otherwis came within day order also problem set,i ’ m glad buy phone i ’ ve never new phone buying amazon way cheaper buy carrier even apple battery life get phone cycle count scratch pick crack phone perfect condition thankful ship arrive day late i ’ m sure feel problem otherwise come within day order also problem set,"['i', '’', 'm', 'glad', 'buy', 'phone', 'i', '’', 've', 'never', 'new', 'phone', 'buying', 'amazon', 'way', 'cheaper', 'buy', 'carrier', 'even', 'apple', 'battery', 'life', 'get', 'phone', 'cycle', 'count', 'scratch', 'pick', 'crack', 'phone', 'perfect', 'condition', 'thankful', 'ship', 'arrive', 'day', 'late', 'i', '’', 'm', 'sure', 'feel', 'problem', 'otherwise', 'come', 'within', 'day', 'order', 'also', 'problem', 'set']"

Definitely regret this purchase…","Extremely Disappointed with “Excellent” Refurbished iPhoneI am beyond disappointed with this purchase. I bought this phone based on the description that it was “excellent refurbished” condition, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Here’s why I’m giving this a 1-star rating: 1. Overheating Issues: The phone gets hot very quickly during basic use, even when just browsing or texting. It’s uncomfortable to hold and concerning for long-term use. 2. Battery Life is Terrible: Despite the description claiming the battery was at 98%, the phone drains ridiculously fast. I can barely make it through a few hours before needing to charge again. For a phone advertised as “excellent,” this is unacceptable. 3. Scuffed Camera: The camera has visible scuffs on it, making it seem like no effort was made to refurbish or inspect the phone properly before selling it. 4. Battery Cycles Misleading: The phone already had 128 cycles, which isn’t what I would expect from a battery advertised as nearly new. This level of wear should have been disclosed upfront. 5. Stuck Without Options: I can’t go without a phone, so now I’m stuck with a subpar device in a predicament I didn’t sign up for.This was supposed to be a reliable, refurbished phone, but it feels like I’ve been sold something far from “excellent.” I’m very disappointed with this purchase and would strongly recommend others avoid this seller.

***BUYERS WITH SKEPTICAL ANXIETY***","***BUYERS WITH SKEPTICAL ANXIETY***Lets start by saying the review i am about to leave will be my best one to date with tons of detailI spent literally about a week searching for phones that had been refurbished and sold on amazon. You can see that if you click on a specific phone then scroll down alittle there will be the same phone for sale but in different conditions. Most likely these other conditioned phones come from different companies. I seen alot of reviews about people getting scammed and or getting defective phones while scrolling through all the reviews for these companies starting from 1star to about 3 stars. (Obviously 4-5 stars will sell you on the product) after many hours on my venture for phones the one company that seemed to stand out was network store. The bad reviews they had was majorly from late delivery. For some reason these boys like to use FedEx and thats okay with me. I orded my first one and got it a day and a half later which was technically a day early from the original delivery date.When i opened the package to check the phone it was in great shape. There was afew minor issues but nothing for me to truly complain about considering the price. Once i started the hello screen and setting up the data transfer i noticed i got all the way to the end then the update on the new phone crashed.. i reset both phone in hopes that it would reset the transfer and update. I was wrong! It crashed the new phone i had got and during the transfer it disconnected my sim card from my other phone. I had two phones with no service! It was late that night so i woke up the next day and took the new phone to apple to get help or an explanation how to fix. They said they could help but they needed to plug the phone in to their repair laptop. I agreed then after plugging the phone in they realized the port of the phone was damaged and needed to be replaced which can cost anywhere from 300-700$ !!!! Grasping for both phones with anxiety and frustration i left the store and immediately went to a tech store to see what they would charge and they quoted the same. I went to my phone carrier to get another sim card which costed me $10 so i could have service again. then started the process of getting a refund on the amazon app. Amazon’s customer service reached out the the company to notify them of the issue and they confirmed i should hear back from the seller within 48hours. I eventually heard from the company and told them the issue. They immediately send a prepaid label to send the phone back to them in which i did that same day. 2 days later i received another 15 pro max 512gig black titanium phone that is nothing less than excellent shape. After a 16 hour data transfer i am now able to sit here and say these boys are the truth. They corrected a defective product with a even better one and didn't overly press about it. I can say i will be book marking this company in particular when it comes to buying anything refurbished again. I hope this can give someone an idea of the integrity they have. I will not deny that it was not an easy process and yes i did lowkey freak out thinking i was out of 950$ but they came through.The next best thing i can tell you is please do your research when it comes to jumping from an older phone or just a newer phone in general. I went from a 11pro max to a 15 pro max and the process of eliminating the physical sim card put me in a real bind.Last but not least, UPDATE THE PHONE FIRST!!!!!!!!After you update it then you can reset the phone then start the data transfer process. If all else fails you have to connect the phone to a laptop in DFU mode then manually update it. With the first phone i got i could have updated it first then loaded all my stuff on it and never knew the port had an issue. But since i did figure it out that means i couldn’t manually update it to fix the crashed out phone i got the first time.Once again thanks for correcting this. I cannot wait to take pictures and videos with my daughter this summer with my new phone.","***buyers with skeptical anxiety***lets start by saying the review i am about to leave will be my best one to date with tons of detaili spent literally about a week searching for phones that had been refurbished and sold on amazon. you can see that if you click on a specific phone then scroll down alittle there will be the same phone for sale but in different conditions. most likely these other conditioned phones come from different companies. i seen alot of reviews about people getting scammed and or getting defective phones while scrolling through all the reviews for these companies starting from 1star to about 3 stars. (obviously 4-5 stars will sell you on the product) after many hours on my venture for phones the one company that seemed to stand out was network store. the bad reviews they had was majorly from late delivery. for some reason these boys like to use fedex and thats okay with me. i orded my first one and got it a day and a half later which was technically a day early from the original delivery date.when i opened the package to check the phone it was in great shape. there was afew minor issues but nothing for me to truly complain about considering the price. once i started the hello screen and setting up the data transfer i noticed i got all the way to the end then the update on the new phone crashed.. i reset both phone in hopes that it would reset the transfer and update. i was wrong! it crashed the new phone i had got and during the transfer it disconnected my sim card from my other phone. i had two phones with no service! it was late that night so i woke up the next day and took the new phone to apple to get help or an explanation how to fix. they said they could help but they needed to plug the phone in to their repair laptop. i agreed then after plugging the phone in they realized the port of the phone was damaged and needed to be replaced which can cost anywhere from 300-700$ !!!! grasping for both phones with anxiety and frustration i left the store and immediately went to a tech store to see what they would charge and they quoted the same. i went to my phone carrier to get another sim card which costed me $10 so i could have service again. then started the process of getting a refund on the amazon app. amazon’s customer service reached out the the company to notify them of the issue and they confirmed i should hear back from the seller within 48hours. i eventually heard from the company and told them the issue. they immediately send a prepaid label to send the phone back to them in which i did that same day. 2 days later i received another 15 pro max 512gig black titanium phone that is nothing less than excellent shape. after a 16 hour data transfer i am now able to sit here and say these boys are the truth. they corrected a defective product with a even better one and didn't overly press about it. i can say i will be book marking this company in particular when it comes to buying anything refurbished again. i hope this can give someone an idea of the integrity they have. i will not deny that it was not an easy process and yes i did lowkey freak out thinking i was out of 950$ but they came through.the next best thing i can tell you is please do your research when it comes to jumping from an older phone or just a newer phone in general. i went from a 11pro max to a 15 pro max and the process of eliminating the physical sim card put me in a real bind.last but not least, update the phone first!!!!!!!!after you update it then you can reset the phone then start the data transfer process. if all else fails you have to connect the phone to a laptop in dfu mode then manually update it. with the first phone i got i could have updated it first then loaded all my stuff on it and never knew the port had an issue. but since i did figure it out that means i couldn’t manually update it to fix the crashed out phone i got the first time.once again thanks for correcting this. i cannot wait to take pictures and videos with my daughter this summer with my new phone.","***buyers with skeptical anxiety***lets start by saying the review i am about to leave will be my best one to date with tons of detaili spent literally about a week searching for phones that had been refurbished and sold on amazon. you can see that if you click on a specific phone then scroll down alittle there will be the same phone for sale but in different conditions. most likely these other conditioned phones come from different companies. i seen alot of reviews about people getting scammed and or getting defective phones while scrolling through all the reviews for these companies starting from 1star to about 3 stars.

Exceptional iPhone","I recently purchased this phone, and it arrived in absolutely flawless condition. The battery cycle count was impressively low at just 2, indicating minimal use. However, I found it quite puzzling that my app indicated it was ineligible for trade-in, which seemed rather suspicious. I reached out to Apple for clarification, but they were unable to provide an explanation for this issue. Despite this, the phone functioned perfectly for all my needs, and I absolutely adore it.","i recently purchased this phone, and it arrived in absolutely flawless condition. the battery cycle count was impressively low at just 2, indicating minimal use. however, i found it quite puzzling that my app indicated it was ineligible for trade-in, which seemed rather suspicious. i reached out to apple for clarification, but they were unable to provide an explanation for this issue. despite this, the phone functioned perfectly for all my needs, and i absolutely adore it.","i recently purchased this phone, and it arrived in absolutely flawless condition. the battery cycle count was impressively low at just 2, indicating minimal use. however, i found it quite puzzling that my app indicated it was ineligible for trade-in, which seemed rather suspicious. i reached out to apple for clarification, but they were unable to provide an explanation for this issue. despite this, the phone functioned perfectly for all my needs, and i absolutely adore it.","i recently purchased this phone, and it arrived in absolutely flawless condition. the battery cycle count was impressively low at just 2, indicating minimal use. however, i found it quite puzzling that my app indicated it was ineligible for trade-in, which seemed rather suspicious. i reached out to apple for clarification, but they were unable to provide an explanation for this issue. despite this, the phone functioned perfectly for all my needs, and i absolutely adore it.",i recently purchased this phone and it arrived in absolutely flawless condition the battery cycle count was impressively low at just 2 indicating minimal use however i found it quite puzzling that my app indicated it was ineligible for tradein which seemed rather suspicious i reached out to apple for clarification but they were unable to provide an explanation for this issue despite this the phone functioned perfectly for all my needs and i absolutely adore it,i recently purchased this phone and it arrived in absolutely flawless condition the battery cycle count was impressively low at just  indicating minimal use however i found it quite puzzling that my app indicated it was ineligible for tradein which seemed rather suspicious i reached out to apple for clarification but they were unable to provide an explanation for this issue despite this the phone functioned perfectly for all my needs and i absolutely adore it,i recently purchased this phone and it arrived in absolutely flawless condition the battery cycle count was impressively low at just  indicating minimal use however i found it quite puzzling that my app indicated it was ineligible for trade which seemed rather suspicious i reached out to apple for clarification but they were unable to provide an explanation for this issue despite this the phone functioned perfectly for all my needs and i absolutely odore it,i recently purchased this phone and it arrived in absolutely flawless condition the battery cycle count was impressively low at just  indicating minimal use however i found it quite puzzling that my app indicated it was ineligible for trade which seemed rather suspicious i reached out to apple for clarification but they were unable to provide an explanation for this issue despite this the phone functioned perfectly for all my needs and i absolutely odore it,recently purchased phone arrived absolutely flawless condition battery cycle count impressively low indicating minimal use however found quite puzzling app indicated ineligible trade seemed rather suspicious reached apple clarification unable provide explanation issue despite phone functioned perfectly needs absolutely odore,recent purchas phone arriv absolut flawless condit batteri cycl count impress low indic minim use howev found quit puzzl app indic inelig trade seem rather suspici reach appl clarif unabl provid explan issu despit phone function perfectli need absolut odor,recently purchase phone arrive absolutely flawless condition battery cycle count impressively low indicate minimal use however find quite puzzle app indicate ineligible trade seem rather suspicious reach apple clarification unable provide explanation issue despite phone function perfectly need absolutely odore,"['recently', 'purchase', 'phone', 'arrive', 'absolutely', 'flawless', 'condition', 'battery', 'cycle', 'count', 'impressively', 'low', 'indicate', 'minimal', 'use', 'however', 'find', 'quite', 'puzzle', 'app', 'indicate', 'ineligible', 'trade', 'seem', 'rather', 'suspicious', 'reach', 'apple', 'clarification', 'unable', 'provide', 'explanation', 'issue', 'despite', 'phone', 'function', 'perfectly', 'need', 'absolutely', 'odore']"

Solid Performance for a Renewed Device, but Expect Signs of Wear","I purchased the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max (Renewed) because I didn’t see the need to pay full price for a brand-new device. The phone arrived in an aftermarket box with a third-party charger, which I expected and had no issue with.The phone itself had small scratches and noticeable wear on the casing, which was disappointing but understandable for a renewed product at a discounted price.The battery life is decent. I ran a battery health check upon receiving it and found it had around 250 charging cycles, which was more than I expected given the release date. That said, after four months of use, the battery has held up well and hasn’t been a concern.Performance-wise, the phone is fast, responsive, and everything I expected from the 15 Pro Max. I love the USB-C charging and having access to the new Apple AI features, which makes the experience even better.Overall, this is a great option if you’re okay with some wear and tear. It offers solid performance at a more reasonable price, but just manage your expectations regarding the cosmetic condition.","i purchased the apple iphone 15 pro max (renewed) because i didn’t see the

iPhone Pro 15 Max","I went from an 11 year old iPhone 7 Plus to an iPhone Pro 15 Max and was so worried about making the switch. The 15 uses a different cable than the 7 lightening cable so needed to invest in a few extra cables and plug in bricks. Overall, a very worthwhile switch.  It was super easy to put all my 7 Plus iPhone info into the new 15 iPhone. Make a back up of old iPhone in iTunes and be sure to tick the box, name it, then use that to set up new iPhone. Is faultless, smooth. A bit of a learning curve learning how to navigate the new iPhone, first knowing how to navigate without the button, but read, read, read. Ask Siri as new methods are needed. LEARN, be patient. Practice, remember. Nobody be afraid to upgrade. Was sooooo worth it.

iPhone 15 Pro Max","I really love this phone. I upgraded from the iPhone 12 to the 15 Pro Max and I’m loving it so far. But here are only a few complaints… When I bought this phone, I transferred all my data and stuff from my old phone to this new one. But, when I tried to get this phone activated, my phone carrier said this phone was still locked, even though on here, it says it’s unlocked. And I had a hard time getting my eSIM cut on, so that was a hassle. And then, the battery health is on 89%. Which isn’t that bad, but I thought it would at least be on 99% or something for this price. But other than that, there’s no scratches or anything broken on this phone and it looks brand new.

Satisfied","I was not sure what to expect with a refurbished phone off Amazon, but I was very pleasantly surprised of the quality and ease of setup with my iPhone 15 pro max. It seemed like a brand new phone except for one thing.. while setting up my phone it presented me with the option of my phone number or a different number I did not recognize. I’m guessing this is the previous owners phone number. This number remained in the phone settings until I did a deep dive and deleted the e-sim from that number. Other than that weird encounter every thing else was smooth.

A Good Gamble","Used is something that I have always been hesitant about. I tool a gamble cause for $1050 for this phone right now is a good deal. I got the device and was impressed by the condition. Outside cosmetically was in great condition and battery health was perfect. Only issue was a deep scratch on the display. Bought excellent condition, and that to me wasn't excellent. However, with how good of condition everything else was I would definitely take a gamble. Cause if you get the right one then it more environmentally friendly and you get a great deal.

Phone works like new.","I can hardly believe this phone is refurbished - it seems brand new. I haven't bought refurbished electronics before.I usually hang on to my phones until they quit working and then buy a new one from the wireless provider, but this time I wanted an unlocked phone. It looks new and functions perfectly, and was very reasonably priced for an unlocked phone that will allow me to change wireless providers. Setting up the esim card was a bit complicated for me; I think it's easy to think something isn't working at first. Maybe it depends on your wireless provider, though. I had my tech-savvy daughter help me with the set-up, and it works great.","i can hardly believe this phone is refurbished - it seems brand new. i haven't bought refurbished electronics before.i usually hang on to my phones until they quit working and then buy a new one from the wireless provider, but this time i wanted an unlocked phone. it looks new and functions perfectly, and was very reasonably priced for an unlocked phone that will allow me to change wireless providers. setting up the esim card was a bit complicated for me;

Non genuine Apple parts used to refurbish iPhone.","I didn’t want to spend $1,000 on a brand-new phone for my older mother, so I thought a $400 refurbished iPhone would be a smart, budget-friendly choice (especially since it would be her first iPhone). We went to our wireless carrier to add her to my plan, and right off the bat, the phone was set to a different language. It took two employees 15 minutes just to switch it to English.We proceeded with transferring her phone number over and basic setup of the phone. When we got home, I created an Apple ID for her and tried to add her emai…then I saw a red notification in Settings that said, “Unknown Part.” Tapping it revealed a message stating “Unable to verify if display is a genuine Apple part.” Are you serious?So now, after spending my entire Sunday setting everything up, I’m going to have to undo it all and return this phone. I’m furious. Beyond furious. My mom doesn’t understand phone plans; my dad handled all of that, and he passed away recently. I added her to my plan to help her and to make sure that she has reliable way of communicating since I moved to Texas, and she’s back in California. We set up her phone during her one-week visit out here and she is set to fly home tomorrow. The phone is already tied to mine and my husbands plan, and her plan she had with my father is cancelled. And for anyone who has ever dealt with changes on a phone plan knows that the main account holder is the person who has to do everything. Which means I will need to send my mother home without a phone until we get a new phone and I drag my husband once again down to the store to connect the new phone, I’ll have to reset up the new phone and then mail it from Texas to her in California. And all the while, will have no way of contacting her… and she will have a phone to contact anyone.The fact that the phone was repaired using non-genuine Apple parts completely derailed everything. This wasn’t an accident—it was deliberate. The seller knowingly passed off a product with unauthorized repairs as a legitimate iPhone and charged accordingly. That’s not just misleading—it’s fraud.A simple refund isn’t enough. This seller should be removed from Amazon Prime, and Amazon needs to do a better job vetting Prime sellers. I’ve always trusted Amazon to ensure its Prime vendors are reputable, but clearly, that trust was misplaced. Lesson learned.","i didn’t want to spend $1,000 on a brand-new phone for my older mother, so i thought a $400 refurbished iphone would be a smart, budget-friendly choice (especially since it would be her first iphone). we went to our wireless carrier to add her to my plan, and right off the bat, the phone was set to a different language. it took two employees 15 minutes just to switch it to english.we proceeded with transferring her phone number over and basic setup of the phone. when we got home, i created an apple id for her and tried to add her emai…then i saw a red notification in settings that said, “unknown part.” tapping it revealed a message stating “unable to verify if display is a genuine apple part.” are you serious?so now, after spending my entire sunday setting everything up, i’m going to have to undo it all and return this phone. i’m furious. beyond furious. my mom doesn’t understand phone plans; my dad handled all of that, and he passed away recently. i added her to my plan to help her and to make sure that she has reliable way of communicating since i moved to texas, and she’s back in california. we set up her phone during her one-week visit out here and she is set to fly home tomorrow. the phone is already tied to mine and my husbands plan, and her plan she had with my father is cancelled. and for anyone who has ever dealt with changes on a phone plan knows that the main account holder is the person who has to do everything. which means i will need to send my mother home without a phone until we get a new phone and i drag my husband once again down to the store to connect the new phone, i’ll have to reset up the new phone and then mail it from texas to her in california. and all the while, will have no way of contacting her… and she will have a phone to contact anyone.the fact that the phone was repaired using non-genuine apple parts completely derailed everything. this wasn’t an accident—it was deliberate. the seller knowingly passed off a product with unauthorized repairs as a legitimate iphone and charged accordingly. that’s not just misleading—it’s fraud.a simple refund isn’t enough. this seller should be removed from

Non genuine Apple parts used to refurbish iPhone.","I didn’t want to spend $1,000 on a brand-new phone for my older mother, so I thought a $400 refurbished iPhone would be a smart, budget-friendly choice (especially since it would be her first iPhone). We went to our wireless carrier to add her to my plan, and right off the bat, the phone was set to a different language. It took two employees 15 minutes just to switch it to English.We proceeded with transferring her phone number over and basic setup of the phone. When we got home, I created an Apple ID for her and tried to add her emai…then I saw a red notification in Settings that said, “Unknown Part.” Tapping it revealed a message stating “Unable to verify if display is a genuine Apple part.” Are you serious?So now, after spending my entire Sunday setting everything up, I’m going to have to undo it all and return this phone. I’m furious. Beyond furious. My mom doesn’t understand phone plans; my dad handled all of that, and he passed away recently. I added her to my plan to help her and to make sure that she has reliable way of communicating since I moved to Texas, and she’s back in California.

Faulty product, no support.","Front camera stopped working completely after only 6 months.  Of course, this was outside the 90 day window of returns for an ""excellent"" condition product.  It had to be ""premium"" to qualify for the year warranty.  So learning from experience, read carefully which category your product falls into.  It is sad that Amazon puts their name on the product in their renewed store, but will offer little to no support when it is obviously a defect in the product and not user use or damage.

Eh I wouldn’t buy again","I like the phone. It has good qualities but I’ve had such issues with this phone already and it’s been 5 days. Currently waiting for the seller to reply to me.I bought an excellent condition iPhone 14, purple. Supposed to be free of scratches on the screen & no dents/cracks within 12in view… mine has 2 what looks to be bite marks & scratches on the screen. Contacted the seller they said I could choose 1 of 3 things… partial refund ($25) and keep the phone. Refund & send back. Or return & replacement. I chose the $25 & keep because it was small things & it would be a hassle to send it back & replace it.A couple days go by & I start making phone calls. Other caller says they can’t hear me. I’m muffled or cutting out. 3 or 4 people have now said they can’t hear me on this “excellent” condition phone. So now I’m having to contact them and/or fork out $70+ to fix the speaker issue. Just do yourself a favor and spend the extra and buy it new.Also a $25 refund on the $300+ phone compares to a .10 raise at your job, in my opinion.

Reviews are deceiving","For an Excellent Refurbished product, I expected much better. Obvious scuffs on the camera. Battery Health is 84%! Horrible for the price. All of the reviews rave about a near full battery health- the most important thing to me when buying a new phone.

Packaging was also very poor and did not indicate fragile or having cushioning in any way for the phone.

Got my iPhone14 today! It arrived earlier than expected, so I was super excited! Set it up just fine, the phones screen isn’t scratched or chipped anywhere, neither are the back glass or the lenses. The phone functions mostly as it should…. Once I started to use it I noticed there’s a rattle like there is something loose inside of the phone. Upon getting my first notification, I realize the vibration is very weird, not what an iPhone normally sounds or feels like… so I wonder if that’s what is rattling inside of it 🙃. It also almost feels like the screen is loose on part of it. Appearance wise there is nothing off, but whomever repaired and recertified this phone was either rushing through their jobs, or they didn’t care whether it was done correctly or not!! Video attached, only one video is allowed per review so I compiled 2 videos into 1 to show both issues. 2 stars since it came early, and outside of the loose vibratory box ( I made the term up 😂, I’m not phone savvy) it works as it should.","the media could not be loaded.

***BUYERS WITH SKEPTICAL ANXIETY***","***BUYERS WITH SKEPTICAL ANXIETY***Lets start by saying the review i am about to leave will be my best one to date with tons of detailI spent literally about a week searching for phones that had been refurbished and sold on amazon. You can see that if you click on a specific phone then scroll down alittle there will be the same phone for sale but in different conditions. Most likely these other conditioned phones come from different companies. I seen alot of reviews about people getting scammed and or getting defective phones while scrolling through all the reviews for these companies starting from 1star to about 3 stars. (Obviously 4-5 stars will sell you on the product) after many hours on my venture for phones the one company that seemed to stand out was network store. The bad reviews they had was majorly from late delivery. For some reason these boys like to use FedEx and thats okay with me. I orded my first one and got it a day and a half later which was technically a day early from the original delivery date.When i opened the package to check the phone it was in great shape. There was afew minor issues but nothing for me to truly complain about considering the price. Once i started the hello screen and setting up the data transfer i noticed i got all the way to the end then the update on the new phone crashed.. i reset both phone in hopes that it would reset the transfer and update. I was wrong! It crashed the new phone i had got and during the transfer it disconnected my sim card from my other phone. I had two phones with no service! It was late that night so i woke up the next day and took the new phone to apple to get help or an explanation how to fix. They said they could help but they needed to plug the phone in to their repair laptop. I agreed then after plugging the phone in they realized the port of the phone was damaged and needed to be replaced which can cost anywhere from 300-700$ !!!! Grasping for both phones with anxiety and frustration i left the store and immediately went to a tech store to see what they would charge and they quoted the same. I went to my phone carrier to get another sim card which costed me $10 so i could have service again. then started the process of getting a refund on the amazon app. Amazon’s customer service reached out the the company to notify them of the issue and they confirmed i should hear back from the seller within 48hours. I eventually heard from the company and told them the issue. They immediately send a prepaid label to send the phone back to them in which i did that same day. 2 days later i received another 15 pro max 512gig black titanium phone that is nothing less than excellent shape. After a 16 hour data transfer i am now able to sit here and say these boys are the truth. They corrected a defective product with a even better one and didn't overly press about it. I can say i will be book marking this company in particular when it comes to buying anything refurbished again. I hope this can give someone an idea of the integrity they have. I will not deny that it was not an easy process and yes i did lowkey freak out thinking i was out of 950$ but they came through.The next best thing i can tell you is please do your research when it comes to jumping from an older phone or just a newer phone in general. I went from a 11pro max to a 15 pro max and the process of eliminating the physical sim card put me in a real bind.Last but not least, UPDATE THE PHONE FIRST!!!!!!!!After you update it then you can reset the phone then start the data transfer process. If all else fails you have to connect the phone to a laptop in DFU mode then manually update it. With the first phone i got i could have updated it first then loaded all my stuff on it and never knew the port had an issue. But since i did figure it out that means i couldn’t manually update it to fix the crashed out phone i got the first time.Once again thanks for correcting this. I cannot wait to take pictures and videos with my daughter this summer with my new phone.","***buyers with skeptical anxiety***lets start by saying the review i am about to leave will be my best one to date with tons of detaili spent literally about a week searching for phones that had been refurbished and sold on amazon. you can see that if you click on a specific phone then scroll down alittle there will be the same phone for sale but in different conditions. most likely these other conditioned phones come from different companies. i seen alot of reviews about people getting scammed and or getting defective phones while scrolling through all the reviews for these companies starting from 1star to about 3 stars.

Extremely Disappointed – Faulty Device and Terrible Support","I had high expectations when I purchased the iPhone 15 Pro Max from Amazon, listed as being in ""excellent condition."" Unfortunately, my experience was anything but excellent.The phone arrived with the screen already loose, which was concerning, but things got even worse—within less than five minutes of use, the screen completely stopped working. I was shocked that a product described as being in such good condition could arrive in this state.To make matters worse, the refund process has been painfully slow. Amazon’s customer support has been unhelpful, with constant delays and no real urgency in resolving the issue. I expected much better service from a company of this size, especially when dealing with such an expensive product.If you're considering buying a refurbished or ""excellent condition"" device from Amazon, think twice.

Great value","After searching for the best deal on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, I decided to take a chance on this Verizon-carrier refurbished model from Amazon with 256GB storage. I couldn't be happier with my decision!Condition: Virtually FlawlessFirst and foremost, if you're hesitant about buying refurbished, don't be—at least not with this listing. My phone arrived in what appears to be pristine condition. No scratches, scuffs, or signs of previous use. The screen is perfect, and the titanium frame looks brand new. If I hadn't known it was refurbished, I would have assumed it was a new device.Performance & Battery Life: Zero CompromisesThe A17 Pro chip in this phone is blazing fast. Apps open instantly, gaming performance is stellar, and I haven't experienced any slowdowns or crashes. The 256GB of storage is the sweet spot for me—plenty of room for photos, videos, and apps without paying for excessive storage I wouldn't use.Battery life has been exceptional. I easily get through a full day of heavy use with 20-30% battery remaining. Fast charging and MagSafe compatibility work perfectly as expected. Camera System: Professional-Quality ResultsThe camera system on the iPhone 15 Pro Max continues to impress me daily. The 48MP main camera captures incredible detail, and the ultrawide and telephoto lenses give me creative flexibility I never had with previous phones. The Action button makes accessing the camera lightning fast, and the results are consistently stunning even in challenging lighting conditions.Verizon Carrier ExperienceActivation with Verizon was seamless. The phone came ready to connect to the network, and I haven't experienced any carrier-specific issues. Call quality is excellent, and 5G performance is fast and reliable in my area.Value: UnbeatableThe substantial savings compared to buying new made this purchase a no-brainer. Getting essentially the same experience as a new iPhone 15 Pro Max at a reduced price feels like a smart financial decision.Bottom LineIf you're considering this refurbished iPhone 15 Pro Max from Verizon through Amazon, I highly recommend it. The combination of like-new condition, full functionality, and significant cost savings makes this one of the best tech purchases I've made. This is how refurbished products should be—indistinguishable from new but easier on your wallet.","after searching for the best deal on an iphone 15 pro max, i decided to take a chance on this
