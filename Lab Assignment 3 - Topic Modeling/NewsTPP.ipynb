a more exotic car.  front runners\\nincluded the toyota supra turbo and the porsche 924 (1987 model years).\\ni narrowed it down to those two.  i liked the simplicity and handling\\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a porsche.  the supra turbo was less\\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\\ncar.  it had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\\ni was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  i asked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"if you buy the supra, your rate classification will be the same as\\nthe celica (the '85 celica was considered a subcompact and for that\\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  our lower-risk division will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"if you buy the porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  and if you go with\\na 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"but the supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  that doens't make sense.\"\\n \\n that's what the book says.  we don't insure corvettes, either.  for\\nsome reason, the underwriters consider supras - and their drivers -\\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\\n \\ni eventually went with the supra for a number of reasons.  the porsche\\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\\nguy in the back room.  at equal monthly payments, it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the porsche, plus its higher insurance.  i\\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\\ntheft.\\n \\n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\| |\\|)[~|)/~   |   everyone's entitled to my opinion.\\n  / | |/ ||\\|\\  \\_|\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\\n========imagination is more important than knowledge. -

it switches to\\n\"sport\" mode when the electronics figure it,  not when the driver sets\\nthe switch.. which is the proper way to do it, in my opinion.  so what does \"sport\"\\nmode entail?  several things:\\n\\n1) revving to red line (or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy)\\n\\n2) delayed upshifts.  (i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the\\n\\tlow gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and\\n\\twould like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's\\n\\tanother curve approaching)\\n\\n3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is\\n\\tdepressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern\\n\\telectronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.\\n\\tthis is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about\\n\\tto turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as\\n\\tlittle as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.\\n\\nalso, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage\\nthan a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that\\nthe idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a\\nbig assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to\\nuse for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an\\ninattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a\\n5 speed)?  \\n\\nhow many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best\\ngear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will\\nbe some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with\\nall possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in rom is likely to do\\nbetter.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved\\nwrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,\\nlow revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high\\nrevs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if\\none sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.\\n\n",

chip\\nand its communications channel.  the purpose of this chip is twofold:\\n    \\n\\t1) transmit channel\\n\\n\\t    the spoof chip xors the 30 bit encrypted serial number with\\n\\t    a secondary keying variable.  this renders the serial number\\n\\t    unrecoverable with just the system key\\n\\n\\t2) recieve channel\\n\\n\\t    the spoof chip xors the incoming encrypted serial

more\\ninteresting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large,\\nmaking it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and\\na spoofed serial number.  without knowing the system

that\\nthe executive branch actually could extract keys from the escrow houses\\nwithout anyone knowing, or telling. now what? dick has 80 bits of data.\\nwhat the hell's he gonna do with it?\\n\\n\\t1) trot around to the telco and say 'we'd like an unauthorised\\ndecrypting tap'. uh huh.\\n\\t2) break in to watergate and install his own tap (so his people still\\ndo have to break in, neat, huh?) record some noise, then get the executive\\nbranch phone decryption box (huh? they've got one? goodness, wait 'til the\\nwashington post gets hold of this) and decrypt the noise.\\n\\t3) more likely, stare at the key, and say 'oh, hell it's not\\nworth all this bloody hassle'\\n\\n\\ttruth is, even granted *lots* of covert power on the part of\\nthe executive branch, this system is *more* difficult to tap with than\\npots gear. the fact that it is easier to tap than some hypothetical\\nsystem neither you nor i am going to place on our phones is neither\\nhere nor there.\\n\\n\\tthe only rational concerns i am seeing raised are:\\n\\n\\ta) is the key really just chopped in half, and not some xor\\narrangement? that is, has some egregious technical error been built\\nin to the plan?\\n\\tb) is this is the first step toward strict regulation of strong\\nencryption?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tthis is b), of course. i suspect not. if the government actually\\nwanted to make such regs, they'd just do it. a few hundred people on usenet\\nyelling about it wouldn't even slow the machine down.\\n\\n\\tbesides, who is this mysterious 'they' who's going to take away\\nall our rights the instant we let our guard down? congress? that gang\\nof buffoons can't even balance their checkbooks. the fbi? but.. they\\ndon't make the laws. the nsa? ditto. the white house? bill clinton\\nis probably still looking for the bathroom. it's a big place, after all.\\n\\n\\tandrew\n",
